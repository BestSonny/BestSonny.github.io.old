My research interests are in computer vision, machine learning and pattern recognition, After obtaining my bachelor degree (1st-class) from [Department of Software Engineering](http://www.scu.edu.cn/software2012/), [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/en/). I became a Research Assistant in [Multimedia Laboratory](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), which is one of the world-leading research group on deep learning and computer vision.


In my senior year, I got an excellent intern opportunity at [Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology](http://english.siat.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Science](http://english.cas.cn/), where I started to tackle the challenging task of scene text recognition. This is completely new thing to me. Although text recognition from scanned documents is well studied, recognizing scene text unconstrained environments is still far from developed. The main difficulty arises from the large diversity of text patterns (e. g. low resolution, low contrast, and blurring), and highly complicated background clutters, which pose the main challenge in our project. In the first three months, we developed a number of deep convolutional networks in an effort to improve the performance. However, few of the them worked reliably with a high accuracy. Then we turned to design the recurrent neural networks (RNN) by leveraging the sequential nature of the text information. This allows us to propose a novel [Deep-Text Recurrent Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04395) that considers the challenging text recognition as a sequence labeling problem. The new model perfectly solves the main challenge of previous approaches, avoiding the difficult character segmentation. The excellent performance of our new method finally lead to a recent paper accept to the [AAAI-16](http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai16.php), which is one of the top conferences on Artificial Intelligence (AI). We also submitted an International Patent application for this work (PCT/CN2015/081308).
